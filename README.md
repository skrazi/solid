# SOLID Principles
All the five SOLID principles have been inplemented in this project. The project is like a mp3 management system where there are different media like Song, Podcast, AudioBook etc.

Different applications use different mp3 media according to their needs. 
1. Spotify uses Song and Podcast.
2. ApplePodcasts uses only Podcast
3. Audible uses AudioBooks

There are various interfaces like MusicPlayer, PodcastPlayer and AudioBookPlayer that are implemented by the above mentioned applications.
Using these interfaces and classes allowed me to easily include all the SOLID principles in my project. Thus, resulting in clean code.

All in all, this project gave me a solid understanding of SOLID principles.
